## Why?

### The Problem

- In-person communication is the ultimate thing, it's high bandwidth, engages all the senses, and is immediate and personal
- Other communication tools for the open-source world (like IRC, GitHub Issues, etc) are low-bandwidth, interruptive, inpersonal, and frustrating
- Video communication tools (like Skype, Google Hangouts, Sqwiggle) are not catered to open-source project's infinitely large teams and requirement to open-source everything
- Communication tools (like Skype) had too much over-head, you had to arrange meetings, schedule times, across many time-zones, with many remote workers, delaying progress in the mean-time, often in an never-ending loop
- Other communication tools (like Skype, Google Hangouts, Sqwiggle, GitHub Issues, etc) are closed, giving the people no power to create their ideal experiences


### The Solution

- People log in to Interconnect
- Their video is made available, so people can see your availability
- If you are busy, you mark yourself as busy so others can't interrupt you
- If you are interupptable, people can click you (and others) to start an instant (group) video call
- There is a text chat on the left for asynchronous communication and sharing resources
- It is open-source, so you can tweak it to work best for your requirements


### The Vision

- Consultants, Trainers, and Experts no longer need to fly around the world to assist co-workers in their office
  - Instead they can join the virtual office, which is just as good, if not better, than the real office
- Remote open-source teams now finally have access to high-bandiwdth communication
